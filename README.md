# kaggle-expedia-hotel-recommendations
SK's 72nd place (out of 1974) solution to Kaggle "Expedia Hotel Recommendations" competition (completed on 2016-06-10)

Note that I had only a few days to invest in this one, and made just 3 submissions, so this is a quick and dirty solution that uses XGBoost in a pretty straightforward way, and blends with the well-discussed leakage solution form the competition forums (but the devil is in the details, as usual).
